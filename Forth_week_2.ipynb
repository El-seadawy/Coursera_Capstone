    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this Project is to help people in selecting a place for their new bussines in new york.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Which Tried to Solve:\n",
    "\n",
    "The major purpose of this project, is to suggest good places for new venues to open, by looking for neighborhoods with the least amount of venues of this type.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Location:\n",
    "New York is a big city, and there is alwyas a competation there between new venues, so insted of jumping right into them, it will be easier to open your venue in a place where there is almost no compatetors!!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Foursquare API:\n",
    "This project would use Four-square API as its prime data gathering source as it has a database of millions of places, especially their places API which provides the ability to perform location search, location sharing and details about a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Work Flow:\n",
    "Using Foursquare API, we will look for each venue of the specified type in each neighborhood, than using clustering we will choose the neighborhoods with the least amount of venues of the specified type and recommend it as a place for a new venue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clustering Approach:\n",
    "To know how many venues of the specified type is in a neighborhood we will use clustering to connect each venue to its neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries Which are Used to Develope the Project:\n",
    "Pandas: For creating and manipulating dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Folium: Python visualization library would be used to visualize the neighborhoods cluster distribution of using interactive leaflet map.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit Learn: For importing k-means clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geocoder: To retrieve Location Data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib: Python Plotting Module.\n",
